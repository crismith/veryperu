Contributors: mechuram 
Tags: woocommerce, price, weight, price customization
Stable tag: trunk
Requires PHP: 7.0
Tested up to: 5.4
Requires at least: 4.4

WooCommerce Price Per Unit allows the user to show prices recalculated per units(weight) and do some other customization to the appearance of prices

== Description ==
IMPORTANT NOTICE: With this version of free plug-in come a different approach to free version. Single product settings were removed. This is because the development of free version and PRO version was unified to simplify the parallel development for me. This also means more regular updates in free version.
If you want to use the Single product settings please buy PRO version or DO NOT update the plug-in anymore.
== New plug-in Sell by Weight PRO available ==

This plug-in allows you to sell easily products, where you want to have several weight option to sell at the same price for kilogram.
It works in a similar way as Variable products, but it is easier to manage because you will enter the price only once and the options price is calculated automatically.

More info here - [Sell by Weight PRO](https://mechcomp.cz/sell-by-weight-pro/)

== PRO version available ==

[Price per Unit PRO](https://mechcomp.cz/price-per-unit-pro/)

**PRO version features:**

* Single product settings - possibility to set the settings for each product individually and override the general settings
* Better variations support - The variation shows price per unit after selecting.
* It’s possible to enter custom number of units(for example kilograms) which is different from the weight – for the purpose you sell products with packing and you need to display recalculation for net weight and at the same time you need to keep gross weight for shipping purposes
* This feature can now also be entered differently for separate variations on variable products
* Change of recalculation per different unit (keeps the original weight, but shows the price per new unit)
* Recalculation ratio – multiplies the price with this ratio – work for example if you want to show price per 100 grams (if you have shop in kg you enter 0.1)

**Description**


This is an extension for WooCommerce which will help you to sell products where can be important for the customer to know how much a weight unit costs.
For example when selling food. Price is recalculated per weight and then shown according to your liking. The rules can be set store-wide or just for certain products.
**Main function of the plug-in is, that it takes the price of your product and divides this price by its weight, this is then displayed to your liking**

== Important notice ==

**This plug-in works only if you have weight set on the product. This is independent setting used for shipping purposes.**

**You can find it here:**
Products->All products->some of your products->Shipping->Weight

**For variable products with different weight of variations:**
Products->All products->some of your products->Variations->some variation->Weight

**Recalculated price can be shown**

* Instead of original price
* As a new row after original price

You can also add some text after recalculated price for example "/Kg"
Price is recalculated only when the weight is set on the product.

**There are also two different settings depending on viewed page**

* Settings for store page
* Settings for single product page
  
**This plug-in can do also some other customization to the appearance of the price**

* Additional custom text for all prices
* You can hide original price when product is on sale
* Additional custom text for variations
* You can hide maximum price for variable products

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is it possible to set recalculation just for one product? =

Yes. You have to go to product editor, tab Price per unit and set an override to the rule you want. It works then even despite the global settings is turned off.

= I have recalculation on, but the price seems untouched. What's wrong?  =

Recalculated price is shown only when the recalculation takes place. That means if you don't have the weight set on the product, nothing happens to the price. Make sure you have weight set.

= I want to use only other features, not recalculation. Is it necessary to have recalculation on?  =

No. Some features are independent on recalculation, you will find them as "General price options" and "Options for variable products" those settings are store wide - they will affect all products.
